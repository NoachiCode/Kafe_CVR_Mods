[![Download Latest WrongMic.dll](../.Resources/DownloadButtonEnabled.svg "Download Latest WrongMic.dll")](https://github.com/kafeijao/Kafe_CVR_Mods/releases/latest/download/WrongMic.dll)

Really simple mod that saves the microphone depending on the platform. No configuration required, just install, change
the microphone with the usual in-game menus if it's wrong, and then forget about it. Say goodbye to people saying:
`Wrong Mic`!
