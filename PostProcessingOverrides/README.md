This mod gives you more control over the world's Post Processing configurations.

Requires [BTKUILib](https://github.com/BTK-Development/BTKUILib)

## Features

* Enable/Disable/Force/Override Post processing configurations for the current world (persistent).
* Choose between `Original`, `Global`, `Custom`, and `Off` for which Post Processing configuration type should be use
  for the current world.
* Chose which Configuration Type a world gets when you join for the first time (via melon preferences).
* While using `Global` or `Custom`, you can configure the settings to be: `Off`, `Original`, or `Override`.

### Configuration Types:

- **Global:** The world will use your **Global** Post Processing configuration. This configuration will be shared across
  all worlds with this type (you can customize it).

  world (you can customize it).
- **Off:** The world will have the Post Process completely turned off.

### Configuration Override Setting

- **Off:** Will disable this setting completely.
- **Original:** Will use the original world's setting.
- **Override:** Will use the setting from our defined Post Process configuration.
