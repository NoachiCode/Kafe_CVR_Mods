# TeleportRequest

[![Download Latest TeleportRequest.dll](../.Resources/DownloadButtonEnabled.svg "Download Latest TeleportRequest.dll")](https://github.com/kafeijao/Kafe_CVR_Mods/releases/latest/download/TeleportRequest.dll)

This mod allows you to request to teleport to other players. You're only able to request/accept if the world allows 
flight.

This mod uses the [RequestLib](../RequestLib/README.md), so the other person doesn't need specifically this mod to
accept a teleport request, they just need the [RequestLib](../RequestLib/README.md)

## Features
- Request to teleport to a player.
- Accept/Decline a request to teleport.
- Teleport yourself to the previous location before teleporting to a player.

### Optional ChaBox Integration

I added some commands you can use via the `ChatBox`, you can configure the commands on the melon prefs

- Send `/tpr @username` to request to teleport.
- Send `/tpa` to accept all pending teleport requests.
- Send `/tpa @username` to accept a teleport request from `@username`.
- Send `/tpd` to decline all pending teleport requests.
- Send `/tpd @username` to decline a teleport request from `@username`.
- Send `/tpb` to teleport to a previous location.
