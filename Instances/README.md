Instances is a simple mod for ChilloutVR that enhances the management of world instances.

Requires [BTKUILib](https://github.com/BTK-Development/BTKUILib)

## Features

* Rejoin the last instance you were in last time you closed the game (if it still exists).
* When starting the game, join on an online Instance of the Home world (you can configure the privacy type and region).
* Keep a history of the last 12 visited instances that you can rejoin with a single click.
* Hold `Left Shift` key when starting the game to load into an offline Instance.

**Note:** The rejoining the last instance takes priority over the joining an online instance. In case both are activated
at the same time and the last instance is gone, it will then load into an online instance instead.
