[![Download Latest MinimizeWindows.dll](../.Resources/DownloadButtonEnabled.svg "Download Latest MinimizeWindows.dll")](https://github.com/kafeijao/Kafe_CVR_Mods/releases/latest/download/MinimizeWindows.dll)

Simple mod that allows you chose whether you want the Game or Melon Loader Console Windows to be minimized on startup.

In me melon prefs you're able to decide which window to minimize when in Desktop/VR. By default it will only minimize
the Game Window when in VR.
